# Installation Guide

## Conda & Pip Dependencies

Here, we provide a more thorough explanation of the installation process listed in the [main readme](../../readme.md#installation).
Basically, what we does is create a separated conda environment, install `PyTorch` from conda and then install other dependencies one-by-one using `pip`.
The reason for the `cat` command is that `pip install -r requirements.txt` will fail even if only one of the dependencies failed to install and it quickly became infuriating to see an error message eating away 30 minutes of our lives. 

```shell
# Clone this codebase with:
git clone https://github.com/zju3dv/EasyVolcap
cd EasyVolcap

# If you haven't installed conda, 
# We recommend installing it from https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/
# On Ubuntu, these scripts can be used
# cd ~
# wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# chmod +x Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
# ./Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh # and finish the installation as the guide

# Maybe install mamba through conda 
# The recommended way is to use mambaforge directly instead of installing miniconda3
conda install -n base mamba -c conda-forge -y

# Picks up on environment.yml and create a pytorch env
# mamba env create

# If this doesn't work, separate create and update as follows
# Note that as of 2023.04.21, wsl2 with python 3.10 could not correctly initialize or load opengl
# You need manually change the following command to accomodate for that (3.10 to 3.9)
# And update the environtment.yaml file to use python 3.9 instead of 3.10
# mamba create -n easyvolcap "python==3.10" -y
# mamba create -n easyvolcap "python>=3.10,<3.10" -y
mamba create -n easyvolcap "python>=3.10" -y
conda activate easyvolcap
mamba env update # picks up environment.yml

# With the environment created, install other dependencies 
# And possibly modify .zshrc to automatically activate this env
# echo conda activate easyvolcap >> ~/.zshrc
# source ~/.zshrc # actually not needed (already activated)

# Install all pip dependencies one by one in case some fails
# pip dependencies might fail to install, check the root cause and try this script again
# Possible caveats: cuda version? pytorch version? python version?
cat requirements.txt | sed -e '/^\s*#.*$/d' -e '/^\s*$/d' | xargs -n 1 pip install 

# Registers command-line interfaces like `evc` `evc-train` `evc-test` etc.
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation --no-deps
```
<!-- 
```shell
# To add autocompletion
# For zsh
echo "" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "###### EasyVolumetricVideo AutoCompletion Start ######" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "$(which shtab) --shell=zsh -u easyvolcap.utils.import_utils.prepare_shtab_parser | tee $PWD/data/zsh-functions/_evv > /dev/null" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "export fpath=($PWD/data/zsh-functions \$fpath)" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "autoload -Uz compaudit && compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "###### EasyVolumetricVideo AutoCompletion End ######" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "Please reload your shell for auto completion to work"
``` -->

Note that the provided examples in the [main readme](../../readme.md#examples) uses an HDR video, thus you might also need to install a version of `ffmpeg` that supports the `zscale` filter.
<!-- Note that the provided video `output.mp4` is in HDR, thus we need to nstall FFmpeg with zscale filter support for extracting images: -->
```shell
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:savoury1/ffmpeg4
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```

## CUDA Related Compilations

To use any compiled `CUDAExtension`, you need to have the CUDA Toolkit and PyTorch installed and configured.

For PyTorch, running `pip install -e .` (the non-dev install of ***EasyVolcap***) will have already taken care of that.

For the CUDA Toolkit, typically your system administration would have already done so if you're using a shared server for AI realted research. Check under `/usr/local` to find anything related to CUDA.

Then, add these lines to your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` to expose related paths for compilation:
```shell
# CUDA related configs
export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
# @rypan DO NOT Add `CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER` unless you have trouble with test samples !!
export CUDA_HOME="/usr/local/cuda" # @rypan unnecessary maybe
export CUDA_DEVICE_ORDER=PCI_BUS_ID # OPTIONAL: defaults to capability order, might be different for GL and CUDA
```

Let's go through the compilation process with the `tinycudann` package.

To retain the compiled objects without starting over in case anything fails, we recommend first cloning `tinycudann` then perform the compilation and installation manually:

```shell
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn --recursive
cd tiny-cuda-nn/bindings/torch
python setup.py install
```

Or maybe try to install `tiny-cuda-nn` with:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch
```

This is automatically done when installing dependencies for ***EasyVolcap*** using this command above:

```shell
# Install all pip dependencies one by one in case some fails
cat requirements.txt | sed -e '/^\s*#.*$/d' -e '/^\s*$/d' | xargs -n 1 pip install
```

If you still encounter `cannot find -lcuda: No such file or directory` error after setting the above paths, try executing

```shell
# ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so ~/anaconda3/envs/easyvolcap/lib/libcuda.so
ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcuda.so ~/miniconda3/envs/easyvolcap/lib/libcuda.so
```

and then install `tiny-cuda-nn` with: `pip install git+https://github.com/NVlabs/tiny-cuda-nn/#subdirectory=bindings/torch`.

Sometimes (`diff-gaussian-rasterization`), on some systems, the import order of CUDA-compiled extension and PyTorch matters.
On some of our system, if you import PyTorch before the CUDA-compiled extension, it will fail to find some Python symbols.
Try changing the orders if that happens.

```shell
python -c "from diff_gaussian_rasterization import _C" # works
python -c "import torch; from diff_gaussian_rasterization import _C" # might fail
python -c "from diff_gaussian_rasterization import _C; import torch" # should work
```

## Windows

As discussed in [this issue](https://github.com/zju3dv/EasyVolcap/issues/10), the installation commands are tailored for Linux systems but ***EasyVolcap***'s dependency requirements are very loose. Aside from `PyTorch`, which you can install in anyway you like following [their official guide](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) or just reuse your previous environment, also other packages are related to the specific functionality or algorithm you want to run.

During the initialization in the `main.py` script, we will try to recursively import user defined components from the `easyvolcap` folder (also check [`config.py`](../design/config.md#reusing-the-configuration-system)). Some warnings about missing packages might be raised, but as long as you don't use that functionality, it should be fine.

For example, the real-time viewer does not require packages like `pytorch3d` or `open3d` so you could ignore them during import.
We've also tested the viewer functionality (run `evc-gui` to test) on Windows, which requires the following OpenGL and ImGUI related packages:

```
torch
pdbr
ujson
PyGLM
pyperclip
ruamel.yaml
imgui-bundle
opencv-python
```

These packages should be able to be installed directly from the command-line using `pip`.

Sidenote: on macOS (Mac), there's no NVIDIA gpu. We use the CUDA-GL interface to transfer rendered images (a PyTorch tensor, which is a block of CUDA memory) onto the screen (a textured based framebuffer). Thus the real-time viewer isn't fully supported on Mac yet.
